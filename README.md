## What is djank all about ?
Djank is just an open source project made by a group of students in order to learn python. It's aim is to integrate a website with a discord bot and a mobile app made using react-native.

## How to use djank
Well, it's simple, just head on to the [website](https://djank.herokuapp.com) and sign up.
You'll have a default bank balance of $100 (Remember the money is fake!!!!!).
Now u can perform transactions - add or withdraw money, see your transaction history once you've performed some transactions, and change your password 

Spoiler :  Soon, you'll also be able to transfer money to other accounts.
### Have an error ?
Djank is maintained by us, as a hobby. Altough it's tried and tested multiple times, there's a small chance that you may come across a bug 🐛 or error.
